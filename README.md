Implementation of A descent Dai-Liao conjugate gradient method for nonlinear equations paper.

**Abstract**

In this work, we propose an algorithm for solving system of nonlinear equations. The idea is a combination of the descent Dai-Liao method by Babaie- Kafaki and Gambari (Optim. Meth. Soft. 29(3), 583â€“591, 2014) and the hyperplane projection method. Using the monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity assumptions, we prove that the proposed method is globally convergent. Examples of numerical experiment show that the method is promising and efficient compared to the method proposed by Sun et al.
